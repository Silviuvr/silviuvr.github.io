        description: "
As the sole iOS developer for the Stentless project, I played a pivotal role in creating an innovative mobile app designed to assist urologists in managing their patients' care. I collaborated closely with the client, engaging in multiple meetings to bring their vision to life and ensure a seamless UI/UX flow. 
The final project was released to App Store as an Unlisted Application due to privacy reasons.


In addition to my responsibilities as the iOS developer, I also provided valuable support to the Android development team, aiding them in getting the project off the ground.

        description: "
        As a volunteer iOS app developer for the Dynamic Market app, I contributed to the development of the app using SwiftUI. The app was designed to connect local fruits and vegetables distributors with ordinary people, while also enabling users to find fresh, organic produce directly from the app. 
        

        Through my contributions, the Dynamic Market app became a valuable tool for both small business owners and consumers alike.

        description: "The primary objective of the application was to track all events that could occur within the company. The app allowed users to view all available events, and if interested, they could add the events to their favorites. Additionally, the application could fetch all developers from a specific department, along with their skills. When a user logged in, they could access a FAQ table view with answers to common questions employees might have. Finally, the app included a profile page that displayed all of a user's skills and details."
